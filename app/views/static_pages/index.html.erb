  <h2>Welcome on Redmine!</h2>
  <p>Redmine is a free and open source, web-based project management and issue
    tracking tool. It allows users to manage multiple projects and associated
    subprojects. It features per project wikis and forums, time tracking, and
    flexible, role-based access control. It includes a calendar and Gantt charts
    to aid visual representation of projects and their deadlines. Redmine
    integrates with various version control systems and includes a repository
    browser and diff viewer.

  <p>
    The design of Redmine is significantly influenced by Trac, a software package
    with some similar features.

    Redmine is written using the Ruby on Rails framework. It is cross-platform
    and cross-database and supports 49 languages.
